Sprillis is a program I've started working on to help web developers test their websites for vulnerabilities. It does more than most vulnerability scanners though, it goes deeper. What it does, is looks through all the php code in a directory and searches for vulnerable strings.  Currently (In it's alpha stage) it looks for Remote and Local file inclusion, and code injection vulnerabilities. Both of which are very common in web applications. Although that's only a start. In the future I plan on adding the ability to locate Server Side Inclusion, Authentication bypass, Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request forgery, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and more.
